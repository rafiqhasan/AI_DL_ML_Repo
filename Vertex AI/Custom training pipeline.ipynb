In addition to the artifact’s data, you can also read and write the artifact’s metadata. This lets you record arbitrary key-value pairs for an artifact such as the accuracy of a trained model, and use metadata in downstream components – for example, you could use metadata to decide if a model is accurate enough to deploy for predictions."
